# Project Name
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

## General Information
-  The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands


## Conclusions
- # Top 5 predictor variables that influence bike bookings are:
1. Temprature - A coefficient value of 0.4146 indicates that temprature has a significant impact on bike rentals
2. Weathersit (3) Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds - A coefficient value of -0.3074 indicates that light snow and rainy conditions deter people from taking rental bikes
3. Year- A coefficient of 0.2366 indicates that year wise the bike rental numbers are increasing. An increase of 0.2366 units is recorded moving from 2018 to 2019 (with a unit increase in year).
4. Season_Spring: A coefficient of -0.1295 indicates that spring season negatively impacts the number of bike rentals
5. Season_winter: A coefficient of 0.0915 indicates that winter season positively impacts the number of bike rentals

# Business Interpretation
Keeping this in mind, BoomBikes can increase the bike availability and the promotions by using the combination of the following conditions:

1. Temprature is high
2. Weather is clear (Mist, clouds, snow, fog deters people from taking rented bikes)
3. Season is winter (atleast not spring as spring season has a negative coefficient)
4. Most favorable months is September
5. Least favorable months are July, November and December as they are signifacntly impacint the number of bike rentals negatively

All in all, Management can plan their promotions and advertising to entice maximum customers in the month of September, 
no need to give huge discounts in this period as the favorable weather and the season conditions will lure customers in definitely. 
We can try to sign up members for a long term membership in this time period though, by reducing the fee as that can capture the audience
 when they are availing the services and can generate a decent revenue to fall back on when the business is low. 
All the people who become members can also form a static userbase in the unfavorable times as well.

As to all the other months/time situations (when the pandemic situation clears up), focus on days when the weather appears clear/pleasant- 
During this, management can decide to roll out a nice promotional strategy offering discounts on bookings to get good number of bike rentals 
despite the adverse circumstances.
